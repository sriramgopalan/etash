## Decisions

| #     | Topic                          | Resolution |
|-------|--------------------------------|------------|
| AD-01 | Charting library               | `recharts`, admin-only client components (see ADR-009) |
| AD-02 | Trend window                   | Rolling 30 days; activity chart shows one bucket per calendar day (UTC), zero-filled |
| AD-03 | Delta definition               | Each stat-card delta = (count in last 30 days) − (count in the prior 30 days, i.e. days 30–60 ago) |
| AD-04 | Chart metrics                  | Posts, votes, and comments created per day — three series on one chart |
| AD-05 | Status breakdown               | All posts grouped by `PostStatus`, rendered as a single horizontal stacked bar using the existing `StatusBadge` colors |
| AD-06 | Leaderboard sizes              | Top 5 posts (by `voteCount`), top 5 boards (by post count), 5 most recent signups |
| AD-07 | Top posts exclusions           | Exclude `PENDING` and `CLOSED` posts from the top-voted leaderboard |
| AD-08 | Needs-attention trigger        | Show the panel only when there is ≥1 `PENDING` post; CTA links to `/admin/posts?status=PENDING` |
| AD-09 | Data path                      | All data loaded server-side in the RSC page via repository functions; passed to widgets as props (no client fetch) |
| AD-10 | Data model                     | No schema change — every figure is derived by aggregation over existing models |
| AD-11 | Flag                           | Gated behind `ADMIN_DASHBOARD_V2` in `lib/flags.ts`; when off, the legacy stat-card layout renders. Removed after first stable release |
| AD-12 | Accessibility                  | The activity chart carries a visually-hidden data table; the SVG is `aria-hidden` (ADR-009 Decision 3) |
| AD-13 | Empty state                    | Zero-data workspace renders a zero-filled chart and "—" leaderboards without error |

## Glossary

| Term                 | Definition |
|----------------------|------------|
| **Activity**         | Posts, votes, and comments created within the window |
| **Delta**            | Signed difference between the current 30-day period and the prior 30-day period |
| **Needs attention**  | Items requiring an admin action; v1 = posts awaiting moderation (`PENDING`) |
| **Leaderboard**      | A ranked top-N list (top posts, top boards) |
| **Status breakdown** | The distribution of all posts across the `PostStatus` enum |

---

## Data Model

**No schema change.** All dashboard figures are derived via aggregation over the
existing `Post`, `Vote`, `Comment`, `User`, and `Board` models (their `createdAt`,
`status`, and `voteCount` fields). The activity time-series uses
`date_trunc('day', "createdAt")` grouping via a parameterized `$queryRaw` inside the
admin repository (ADR-003: Prisma only in repositories).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given the `ADMIN_DASHBOARD_V2` flag is on, when an admin opens `/admin`, the
   stat cards (Users, Boards, Posts, Votes, Comments) each show a 30-day delta with
   an up/down/flat indicator.
2. Given the flag is off, `/admin` renders the legacy stat-card layout unchanged.
3. The activity chart shows posts, votes, and comments per day for the last 30 days,
   with every day present (missing days rendered as zero).
4. The chart is accompanied by a visually-hidden table containing the same daily
   figures, and the SVG is `aria-hidden`.
5. A posts-by-status stacked bar reflects the count of all posts in each
   `PostStatus`, using the established status colors.
6. The top-posts leaderboard lists the 5 highest-`voteCount` posts, excluding
   `PENDING` and `CLOSED`, each linking to the post.
7. The top-boards leaderboard lists the 5 boards with the most posts.
8. The recent-signups list shows the 5 newest users.
9. Given ≥1 `PENDING` post, a needs-attention panel appears with a count and a CTA
   to `/admin/posts?status=PENDING`; given 0 pending posts, the panel is hidden.
10. Given an empty workspace, the page renders without error: a zero-filled chart
    and empty-state leaderboards.
11. All dashboard data is loaded in the Server Component and passed to widgets as
    props; no widget performs a client-side data fetch.
